# Computer-Methods
# Please Update this README and check it everytime you work on the project

1. Austin Fulmer, 11/24/19, Added more functionality for the file reading. Also have a few ideas for how to get the drawing to work.
2. Evan Wright, 11/24/19, When running Pipe_Main it should now update 3 of the lineEdits based on the values you input in the source lineEdits after clicking the analyze button
3. Austin Fulmer, 11/25/19, Added updated data files and ref_node functionality. Able to draw source lines. Able to draw all device lines except for files 8, 9, and 10. Will ask Dela on monday. Also added full file reading capabilities. Also add comments to Pipe_Class for
easier understanding
4. Evan Wright 12/1/19, The Gui is supposed to open up on the drawing tab which ours now sohuld. The Main and Class are updated with a lot of suggestions from Dela's 40 minute video but they're not fully functional as we will need for the nodes and pipes to calculate their own flow with this method and don't have that yet. The first line or two of the report now prints and an example of what the report should look like is uploaded.
5. Evan Wright 12/2/19, Added report functionality and gui text labels update to match .txt files
6. Evan Wright 12/4/19, Added calculation method for solving for flow. There is a runtime error that causes the answer to be the same as the guess that we need to figure out. Also in line 326 of the class our 2nd guess should be 'self.flow_unit_conv' instead of '3.85' so it'll work with all of the files but that gives another error for some reason. 
7. Evan Wright 12/4/19, reuploaded pipe_class with drawings fixed
